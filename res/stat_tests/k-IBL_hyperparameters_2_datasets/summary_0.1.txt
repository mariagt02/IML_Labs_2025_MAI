Can we reject the null hypothesis (all algorithms are equivalent) at alpha=0.1? Yes
Null hypothesis has been rejected. This means that there is a significant difference between at least two algorithms.
To find out which algorithms differ significantly, we perform the Nemenyi post-hoc test.
Number of significant pairwise differences found: 4
	Significant difference between euc_bc_7_dd and ivdm_bc_3_nr (p-value: 0.0841)
	Significant difference between euc_bc_7_dd and ivdm_bc_3_ar (p-value: 0.0841)
	Significant difference between euc_bc_7_dd and ivdm_bc_3_dc (p-value: 0.0841)
	Significant difference between euc_bc_7_dd and ivdm_bc_3_dd (p-value: 0.0841)
