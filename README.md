pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Repository structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, one for each of the two projects developed:

- `LazyLearning_SVM/`: Contains the code for Work 2: Classification with Lazy Learning and SVMs.
- `Clustering_Visualization/`: Contains the code for Work 3: Clustering and Visualization.

See the respective `README.md` files in each folder for detailed information about the implementation, usage instructions, and file structure for each project.
